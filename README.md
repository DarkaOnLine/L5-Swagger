### Disclaimer
This package is a wrapper of [Swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php) and [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) adapted to work with Laravel.
The actual Swagger spec is beyond the scope of this package. All L5-Swagger does is package up swagger-php and swagger-ui in a Laravel-friendly fashion, and tries to make it easy to serve. For info on how to use swagger-php [look here](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/). For good examples of swagger-php in action [look here](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/petstore.swagger.io).
