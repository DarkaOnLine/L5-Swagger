L5 Swagger - OpenApi or Swagger Specification for your Laravel project made easy.
==========

Swagger 2.0 for Laravel >=5.1

This package is a wrapper of [Swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php) and [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) adapted to work with Laravel 5.

Installation
============

You can publish L5-Swagger's config and view files into your project by running:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider "L5Swagger\L5SwaggerServiceProvider"
```

For Laravel >=5.5, no need to manually add `L5SwaggerServiceProvider` into config. It uses package auto discovery feature. Skip this if you are on >=5.5, if not:

Open your `AppServiceProvider` (located in `app/Providers`) and add this line in `register` function
```php
$this->app->register(\L5Swagger\L5SwaggerServiceProvider::class);
```
or open your `config/app.php` and add this line in `providers` section
```php
L5Swagger\L5SwaggerServiceProvider::class,
```

## Swagger/OpenApi annotations and generating documentation
In order to generate the Swagger/OpenApi documentation for your API, Swagger offers a set of annotations to declare and manipulate the output. These annotations can be added in your controller, model or even a seperate file. An example of [OpenApi annotations can be found here](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/blob/master/tests/storage/annotations/OpenApi/Anotations.php) and [Swagger annotations can be found here](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/blob/master/tests/storage/annotations/Swagger/Anotations.php). For more info check out Swagger's ["pet store" example](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/petstore-3.0) or the [Swagger OpenApi Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).

After the annotiations have been added you can run `php artisan l5-swagger:generate` to generate the documentation. Alternatively, you can set `L5_SWAGGER_GENERATE_ALWAYS` to `true` in your `.env` file so that your documentation will automatically be generated. Make sure your settings in `config/l5-swagger.php` are complete.

I am still using Swagger @SWG annotation
============
If still using Swagger @SWG annotations in you project you should:
- Explicitly require `swagger-php` version 2.* in your projects composer by running:
```bash
composer require 'zircote/swagger-php:2.*'
```
- Set environment variable `SWAGGER_VERSION` to **2.0** in your `.env` file:
```
SWAGGER_VERSION=2.0
```
or in your `config/l5-swagger.php`:
```php
'swagger_version' => env('SWAGGER_VERSION', '2.0'),
```

Using Swagger UI with Passport
============
The easiest way to build and test your Laravel-based API using Swagger-php is to use Passport's `CreateFreshApiToken` middleware. This middleware, built into Laravel's core, adds a cookie to all responses, and the cookie authenticates all subsequent requests through Passport's `TokenGuard`.

To get started, first publish L5-Swagger's config and view files into your own project:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider "L5Swagger\L5SwaggerServiceProvider"
```

Next, edit your `config/l5-swagger.php` configuration file. Locate the `l5-swagger.routes.middleware` section, and add the following middleware list to the `api` route:

```php
'api' => [
  \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
  \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
  \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
  \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
  \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
  \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
  \Laravel\Passport\Http\Middleware\CreateFreshApiToken::class,
  'auth',
]
```

TIPS
============

## L5_SWAGGER_GENERATE_ALWAYS

One of the setting I find useful to enable is `l5-swagger.generate_always`, which will cause your Swagger doc to be regenerated each time you load the Swagger UI (<span style="color:OrangeRed">not intended for production use!</span>). All you have to do to enable this in your dev environment is add an environment variable to `.env` named `L5_SWAGGER_GENERATE_ALWAYS` and set it to `true`.

Swagger-php
======================
The actual Swagger spec is beyond the scope of this package. All L5-Swagger does is package up swagger-php and swagger-ui in a Laravel-friendly fashion, and tries to make it easy to serve. For info on how to use swagger-php [look here](http://zircote.com/swagger-php/). For good examples of swagger-php in action [look here](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/petstore.swagger.io).
